Hey guys! Hope you are having a great weekend. 

When you all get a chance, take a moment to scan the rough draft in the file exchange. I’m going to submit our draft on blackboard around 8 CST, so if anyone notices anything that can be tightened up before then, don’t hesitate to speak up.

Otherwise, great job everyone!

If it's any consolation, it looks pretty good to me. Besides, we're all learning and you did a great job!

Should we use external css or internal css? Any ideas?

Infernal_Chimera — 03/21/2024 8:33 AM
I would say external. It’s less convoluted that way. Just have one css file overall

I believe the contact button looks more professional with the option bar correct?

[11:53 AM]
Let me know what do you all think.

JoeTracy — 03/23/2024 11:58 AM
I like it

Meg — 03/23/2024 11:58 AM
I like it too!

AhmedAlzehhawi — 03/23/2024 12:06 PM
Great! Lets stick with that then.
[12:08 PM]
I’ll remove that contact on the bottom!

JoeTracy — 03/23/2024 1:01 PM
Hello everyone here is what I have so far for the Contact Us form, still working on sizing but I looked around at some other websites and decided to update to a little more modern look

[1:01 PM]
Also
[1:01 PM]
Do we know if we have to have the forms lead to somewhere or are we not worrying about that for now?
[1:01 PM]
I believe we can handle that with the datbase and such
[1:03 PM]
Oh nevermind, we will use email

AhmedAlzehhawi — 03/23/2024 1:07 PM
It looks great!

Hey guys! Sorry I'm sending this so late. I've been up with another project and I'll be busy throughout the day tomorrow so I wanted to send this before I forget. I'm still trying to fix a few things as far as sizing, style, and layout but I wanted to at least get my files up here in the text channel. I've added my flashcard html page and updated Ahmed's stylesheet with what I've used for my section up to this point. So far I think everyone's work is really looking great. Good job everyone!

Hey Everyone I completed the login page and the signup page. The styling of the pages got a little wonky, because I was trying to get the checkbox on the sign up page to be smaller. The text boxes ended up "slightly" different than the pages you all have shown, but its negligible at best. If anyone thinks they can fix that part up then feel free to adjust it or let me know and I can adjust it. Overall though I think everything looks great and works. (edited)

Hey guys! Just got an email back from the professor. 

He wants our presentation uploaded to YouTube by no later than Wednesday (April 3rd). 

As for what we should deliver, he stated that this first demonstration is more of a show that we’ve implemented something up to this point. He did have some other advice so I attached a screenshot of his reply.

Also, thank you @AhmedAlzehhawi for getting those invites to GitHub out to us!
